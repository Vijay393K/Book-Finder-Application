# React + CSS Project

This repository contains a small React component styled with CSS.  
It was developed and tested in **CodeSandbox**, then exported as `.js` and `.css` files.  

---

## Files in this Repository
- **react.js** → The main React component code  
- **style.css** → The CSS stylesheet for styling  

---

## How to Run the Project
Since this is a lightweight React component without a full project setup:

1. Create a new React app using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or open [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).  
2. Replace the contents of `App.js` with the code from **react.js**.  
3. Add the code from **style.css** into a new file and import it into `App.js` like this:  
4. Start the app:  
5. The component should now render with your CSS styles applied.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Write React components
- Apply custom CSS styling
- Structure code cleanly for readability

---

## Notes
- The code was originally written and tested in **CodeSandbox**.  
- To quickly test, you can also copy-paste both files directly into CodeSandbox and run it online.
